# Mr Roboger's Neighborhood

#### By Eliot Gronstal

#### A web application that takes a number from the user and returns a list of values the user's inputted number with substitutions made within the returned list.

## Technologies Used

* Javascript
* HTML
* CSS

## Description

A web application made for my independent project at Epicodus Coding School during Week 3 of Intro to Programming: Arrays & Looping. The site takes a number from the user and returns a list of values from 0 to the user's inputted number with substitutions made within a returned list.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _This is a great place_
* _to list setup instructions_
* _in a simple_
* _easy-to-understand_
* _format_

## TDD

* In my finished program:

The number 4 should be replaced with "Won't you be my neighbor?"
The number 16 should be replaced with "Boop!".
The number 42 should be replaced with "Won't you be my neighbor?"
The number 61 should be replaced with "Boop!".

new test ideas:
function1
function recognizes numbers/puts them in order
put numbers into an array starting at 0
if numbers are input to the array it should return them in order

function2
it should replace number 4 in the array with a string
it should replace number 16 in the array with a string
it should replace number 42 in the array with a string
it should replace number 61 in the array with a string
must push into the array

Describe: fredBotNeighb()

*  Test One
Test: "It should return 1 if the input has just one number."
Code:
const number = 4;
fredBotNeighb(number);
Expected Output: 1

*  Test Two
Test: "It should return 2 if the input has two numbers."
Code:
const digit = 44;
fredBot(number);
Expected Output: 2

*  Test Three
Test: "It should recognize characters within a string."
Code:
const digit = "44";
fredBot(digit);
Expected Output: 1

*  Test Four
Test: "It should recognize numbers within a string."
Code:
const digit = "44 ";
fredBot(digit);
Expected Output: N/A

*  Test Five

*  Test Six

*  Test Seven

*  Test Eight

*  Test Nine

*  Test Ten
